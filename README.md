# Tune Measurement and Correction Systems

This document contains information about discussions and experiments done about tune measurement and correction
systems. Its intention is to help in the comprehension about these two systems, using as an example the systems from
UVX, the current operating particle accelerator at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS).

## Document Structure

The document was developed in LaTeX in a way that each subsection is described by a .tex file. The main file 
TuneSystem.tex groups all the other .tex files together for compilation. The file TuneSystem.pdf should be used
 for lecture. Intending to organize the document's path, all the figures are in the Figures path and the template used
 is in the Template path. Other types of files such as .log or .out are being ignored (.gitignore file) because they don't affect the
 document, they're only general files generated during compilation.
